            <p>
                Because I like the all project idea and love the drawings, I decided to make a <a href="https://www.peppercarrot.com/" target='_blank'>Pepper &amp; Carrot</a>
                theme for the consistency game. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This a work in progress and any help would be appreciated, this is my TODO list:
                <ol>
                    <li>Replace all current item images by Pepper &amp; Carrot related images (extracted from the original comic),</li>
                    <li>Add the ability to choose the new theme on settings menu,</li>
                    <li>Add a (one time) notification of the new theme on the App,</li>
                    <li>Add David Revoy attribution on the about page,</li>
                    <li>Merge with master,</li>
                    <li>Test it,</li>
                    <li>Release new version on android and desktop.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            
            <p>
